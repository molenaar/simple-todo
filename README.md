# Simple To-Do

A streamlined task management web application demonstrating the BMAD (Business Method for Agile Development) methodology. Built with Astro v5, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4, this project showcases progressive complexity development while providing practical task management functionality.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Simple To-Do** addresses productivity tool complexity overload by starting minimal and evolving intelligently through visible BMAD methodology phases. Users experience both practical task management and educational insight into structured development processes.

### Core Features (MVP)
- ✅ **Task Management**: Add, complete, and remove tasks with satisfying interactions
- 💬 **Daily Motivation**: Inspirational quotes with optional like/save/share functionality  
- 🌓 **Theme Toggle**: Seamless dark/light mode switching with system preference detection
- 🎨 **Celebration Micro-interactions**: Delightful animations for task completion satisfaction

### Key Differentiators
- **Methodology Visibility**: BMAD implementation becomes part of the product value
- **Progressive Complexity**: Intelligent growth based on user feedback and structured principles
- **Dual-Purpose Architecture**: Serves end-users and developers learning BMAD methodology
- **Performance-First**: Zero-JavaScript by default with selective enhancement

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (required for Astro v5 compatibility)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/molenaar/simple-todo.git
