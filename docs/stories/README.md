Each story follows BMAD methodology principles and includes:

- **Clear Story Statement**: As a [persona], I want [functionality], so that [benefit]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable requirements for implementation completion
- **Dev Notes**: Comprehensive technical context extracted from architecture documentation
- **Tasks/Subtasks**: Sequential implementation steps with clear deliverables
- **Testing Guidance**: Testing approach, frameworks, and coverage targets
- **Source References**: All technical decisions linked to authoritative architecture documents

## üîÑ Story Lifecycle

Stories progress through the following phases:
1. **Draft** - Initial story creation with full context
2. **Ready** - Validated and approved for development
3. **In Progress** - Currently being implemented
4. **Done** - Implementation complete and validated

## üìñ Reading Guide

**For Developers**: Each story is self-contained with comprehensive technical context. Start with the story statement and acceptance criteria, then review Dev Notes for implementation guidance.

**For Product Owners**: Focus on story statements, acceptance criteria, and business value to ensure alignment with product vision.

**For Scrum Masters**: Use stories to track progress, identify dependencies, and ensure proper handoffs between team members.
