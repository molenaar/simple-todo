## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous story context available.

### Component Architecture
**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/components.md#component-organization-strategy]:
- Place the UploadInterface.astro component in `app/src/components/features/` following the feature-specific component pattern
- Use Astro component (.astro) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow component prop interface patterns with proper TypeScript annotations

**Astro Component Standards** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#astro-component-architecture]:
- Use `.astro` extension for Astro components
- Place styles at the bottom of component files
- Use TypeScript for component scripts
- Follow component prop interface patterns

### File Locations
**Source Tree Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-application-structure]:
- Component location: `app/src/components/features/UploadInterface.astro`
- Follow PascalCase naming convention for Astro components
- Place any related TypeScript interfaces in `app/src/types/index.ts`

### UI Component Guidelines
**Button Component Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization-strategy]:
- Use reusable UI primitives from `app/src/components/ui/`
- Button variants available: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'
- Button sizes available: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
- Follow accessibility patterns with proper focus management

### Styling Standards
**CSS/Tailwind Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#css-tailwind-standards]:
- Use Tailwind utility classes primarily
- Create custom components in @layer components for reusable patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels

**Design System** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#key-technology-decisions]:
- Tailwind CSS v4+ for utility-first styling with design system
- Built-in design system ensures consistency
- Excellent dark/light theme support

### Form Handling
**TypeScript Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-standards]:
- Use explicit type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks
- Use ES6+ features consistently including template literals

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-testing-implementation]:
- Test file location: `app/src/components/features/__tests__/UploadInterface.test.ts`
- Use Vitest and Testing Library for component testing
- Target 90% unit test coverage for component logic
- Test validation, error handling, and user interactions
- Mock file input and form submission for reliable testing

**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid-coverage-goals]:
- Tools: Vitest, Testing Library, JSDOM
- Focus on validation, business logic, and component interactions
- Follow testing pyramid with emphasis on unit tests

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.3+ with strict mode
- Frontend Framework: Astro 5.0+ with .astro file components
- UI Components: Native Astro Components with TypeScript
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS 4.0+ utility-first styling
- Testing: Vitest 2.0+ for unit testing

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: `app/src/components/features/__tests__/UploadInterface.test.ts`
- **Testing frameworks**: Vitest, Testing Library, JSDOM
- **Coverage target**: 90% for component logic and validation
- **Test focus areas**:
  - File input validation (accept .md files only)
  - Textarea validation (non-empty content)
  - Form submission handling
  - Error state management
  - Checkbox state management
  - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

#### Requirements Traceability
- All acceptance criteria are fully met:
  1. Astro component created with proper structure and TypeScript interface.
  2. File input for `.md` files and a `<textarea>` are present, with ARIA labels and accessibility.
  3. "Submit" button and "Overwrite existing file?" checkbox are implemented and styled per design system.

#### Code Quality
- Modern ES6+ syntax, strict TypeScript, and JSDoc comments.
- Follows Astro and project conventions for structure, props, and styling (Tailwind CSS).
- Error handling and validation are robust and user-friendly.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) is well addressed.

#### Test Coverage
- Unit tests cover all validation, error, and success scenarios, including edge cases.
- Tests verify ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and TypeScript interface compliance.
- Test suite is comprehensive and passes.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Security: File type validation, no XSS or unsafe DOM manipulation.
- Performance: Efficient file reading, minimal DOM updates.
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, focus management.

#### Risk Assessment
- Low risk for regression due to strong test coverage and strict typing.
- Minor future enhancements (file size validation, drag-and-drop, preview) are recommended but not required for acceptance.

#### Gate Decision
- Gate: PASS
- Quality Score: 90/100
- Status: Ready for Done

Reviewed after all tests were fixed and passing. Story is fully cleared for "Done" status.
