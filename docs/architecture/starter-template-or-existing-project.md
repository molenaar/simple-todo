# Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis and current project structure, this appears to be a **greenfield project** with specific requirements for Astro v5, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. The project prioritizes:

- Static-first approach with selective hydration
- Zero server-side infrastructure requirements  
- Educational transparency for BMAD methodology demonstration
- Performance optimization (<1 second load times, >95 Lighthouse scores)

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project with clear technology constraints specified in PRD
