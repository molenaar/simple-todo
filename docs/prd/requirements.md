# 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Functional Requirements
1.  **File Upload**: The system must provide an interface to upload a `.md` file from the user's local machine.
2.  **Paste Markdown**: The system must provide a `<textarea>` to allow users to paste raw markdown content as an alternative to file upload.
3.  **Overwrite Confirmation**: The system must ask for explicit user confirmation via a dialog box before overwriting an existing file in storage.
4.  **API Endpoint**: A backend API endpoint (`/api/upload`) must be created to securely receive and process the uploaded content.
5.  **Front Matter Validation**: The API must parse and validate the markdown's front matter against the project's defined schema in `app/src/content.config.ts`.
6.  **Data Persistence**: The API must save the validated markdown file to the `course-content` Azure Blob Storage container using the `{courseId}-{format}.md` naming convention.
7.  **Metadata Update**: The API must create or update the corresponding course metadata in the `courses` Azure Table to ensure the new content is discoverable.
8.  **Feedback Mechanism**: The UI must provide clear, immediate, and easy-to-understand feedback to the user on the status of the upload (e.g., "Success," "Error: Invalid Front Matter").

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements
1.  **Security**: The API endpoint must sanitize all incoming data to prevent XSS or other injection attacks.
2.  **Usability**: The upload interface should be simple, intuitive, and require no technical knowledge or training to operate.
3.  **Performance**: The upload process must be asynchronous and not block the user interface, providing a smooth user experience even with larger files.
