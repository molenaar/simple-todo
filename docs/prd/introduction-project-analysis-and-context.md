# 1. Introduction: Project Analysis and Context

*   **Project Name**: Courseware Schedule Content Upload
*   **Author**: Marcel Molenaar
*   **Date**: September 4, 2025
*   **Version**: 1.0
*   **Target Release**: `0.0.2`

### 1.1. Problem Statement
Content managers lack a simple, web-based method to upload and update course markdown files. The current process requires developer intervention, manual file transfers, and direct interaction with Azure Storage, which is inefficient, error-prone, and creates a bottleneck for content updates.

### 1.2. Project Goal
To create a secure, user-friendly web interface that allows authorized users to upload new or updated course markdown files directly into the existing Azure Storage infrastructure. This will streamline the content management workflow, empower content managers, and reduce reliance on the development team for routine updates.

### 1.3. Current State Analysis
The `courseware-schedule` project is a functional Astro v5 application that dynamically displays course schedules from markdown files stored in Azure Blob Storage. It utilizes Azure Functions for its backend API and Azure Table Storage for metadata. The core architecture is sound, but the content update process is entirely manual and requires technical expertise.

### 1.4. Out of Scope for This Release
*   A comprehensive user authentication and authorization system. For this initial release, the upload page will be located on a non-public, "security by obscurity" URL.
*   A user interface for deleting or renaming files in storage.
*   A WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for creating or editing markdown content from scratch within the browser.
