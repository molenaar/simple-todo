# 3. User Interface Enhancement Goals

### 3.1. New Component: `UploadInterface.astro`
A new, self-contained Astro component will be created to encapsulate the entire upload functionality.

### 3.2. Placement and Accessibility
This component will be placed on a new, non-public admin page located at `app/src/pages/admin/upload.astro`. This page will not be linked from any public-facing navigation menus, sidebars, or sitemaps.

### 3.3. UI Elements and Workflow
The interface will be clean and functional, containing:
*   A clear heading: "Upload Course Content".
*   A file input control restricted to `.md` files.
*   A `<textarea>` for pasting raw markdown.
*   A checkbox labeled "Overwrite existing file?".
*   A "Submit" button to initiate the upload.
*   A dedicated status area to display success, error, or progress messages.

### 3.4. Content Rendering
As per existing project architecture, the uploaded markdown content will be rendered on the dynamic course pages (`app/src/pages/coursecollections/[course].astro`) as direct HTML, ensuring a seamless and performant display.
