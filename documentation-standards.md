## The Five Documentation Rules

These five rules create a navigable, professional documentation system that works across all course materials:

### Rule 1: Every Folder Has README.md
**Requirement**: Every directory must contain a `README.md` file that serves as the entry point for that folder's contents.

**Purpose**: 
- Creates clear navigation entry points
- Ensures no "orphaned" content directories
- Provides consistent user experience

**Implementation**:
```markdown
# Folder Name - Purpose Description
Brief overview of the folder's contents and purpose.

## 📋 Contents
- Links to all major files in the folder
- Brief descriptions of each file's purpose
```

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---

### Rule 2: Every README.md Has TOC
**Requirement**: Every `README.md` file must include a table of contents linking to all other `.md` files in that folder.

**Purpose**:
- Shows all available content at a glance
- Provides direct navigation to specific content
- Creates a hierarchical content structure

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## 📚 Documentation

### Core Documents
- **[Document Name](document-name.md)** - Brief description
- **[Another Document](another-document.md)** - Brief description

### Supporting Materials  
- **[Reference Guide](reference-guide.md)** - Brief description
```

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---

### Rule 3: Top/Bottom Navigation Links
**Requirement**: Every `.md` file must have navigation links at the top and bottom linking back to the parent README.md.

**Purpose**:
- Easy parent navigation without browser back button
- Clear hierarchical relationship  
- Consistent navigation experience

**Implementation**:
```markdown
[← Back to Parent Folder](README.md)

# Document Title
Document content here...

---

[← Back to Parent Folder](README.md)
```

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---

### Rule 4: Emoji Back-to-TOC Links
**Requirement**: For files with a Table of Contents, all major sections must end with a small emoji link back to the TOC.

**Purpose**:
- Quick section jumping within long documents
- Enhanced user experience and navigation
- Visual consistency across all documentation

**Approved Emojis**:
- `[🔝](#table-of-contents)` - Primary choice (back to top)
- `[↑ TOC](#table-of-contents)` - Alternative text-based
- `[⬆️](#table-of-contents)` - Alternative emoji

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Section Title
Content of the section goes here...

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---
```

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---

### Rule 5: Simple Paragraph Names
**Requirement**: All paragraph/section names must be simple to guarantee anchor links work properly.

**Purpose**:
- Ensures reliable internal linking
- Prevents broken navigation
- Consistent URL-friendly anchors

**Guidelines**:
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid special characters except hyphens
- Keep names reasonably short
- Use title case for readability

**Good Examples**:
- `## Getting Started`
- `## Course Overview`  
- `## Implementation Guide`

**Avoid**:
- `## Getting Started (With Special Notes & Details)`
- `## Course Overview - Updated 2024!`
- `## 🎯 Implementation Guide with Examples`

## Navigation Patterns

### Hierarchical Navigation Structure
```
Main README
├── [← Back to Parent] (if applicable)
├── ## TOC with all sub-documents
└── Links to child documents

Sub-Document
├── [← Back to Main README] | [← Back to Parent]
├── ## TOC (if multiple sections)
├── Content with [🔝](#table-of-contents) links
└── [← Back to Main README] | [← Back to Parent]
```

### Multi-Level Navigation
For deep hierarchies, provide multiple navigation options:
```markdown
[← Back to Main README](../README.md) | [← Back to Docs](README.md)
```

### Cross-References
Link to related documents where relevant:
```markdown
See also: [Related Topic](../other-folder/related-topic.md)
```

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---

## TOC Structure Guidelines

### Basic TOC Format
```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Section One](#section-one)
- [Section Two](#section-two)
- [Section Three](#section-three)
```

### Categorized TOC Format
```markdown
## 📚 Documentation

### Core Documents
- **[Document Name](document.md)** - Description
- **[Another Document](document2.md)** - Description

### Reference Materials
- **[Technical Reference](tech-ref.md)** - Description
```

### Exercise TOC Format
```markdown
## Table of Contents

**Day 1 Exercises**
- 1.1. [Exercise Name](#exercise-11---exercise-name)
- 1.2. [Another Exercise](#exercise-12---another-exercise)

**Day 2 Exercises**  
- 2.1. [Advanced Exercise](#exercise-21---advanced-exercise)
```

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

## Emoji Usage Standards

### Navigation Emojis
- `🔝` - Back to top/TOC (primary choice)
- `↑` - Alternative text-based back to TOC
- `⬆️` - Alternative arrow emoji
- `📋` - Table of contents sections
- `📚` - Documentation sections

### Content Category Emojis
- `📖` - Reading materials/documentation
- `💻` - Code/programming content  
- `🎯` - Goals/objectives
- `⚙️` - Configuration/setup
- `🔧` - Tools/utilities
- `📊` - Data/analytics
- `🎓` - Learning/educational content
- `💡` - Tips/best practices

### Status/Priority Emojis
- `✅` - Completed/recommended
- `⚠️` - Warning/attention needed
- `❌` - Deprecated/not recommended
- `🆕` - New content/recently added

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---

## Link Structure Requirements

### Internal Links
```markdown
[Link Text](relative-path.md)
[Section Link](#section-name)
[Cross-Reference](../other-folder/document.md#section)
```

### External Links
```markdown
[External Resource](https://example.com)
```

### Parent Navigation Links
```markdown
[← Back to Main README](README.md)
[← Back to Course Overview](../README.md)
[← Back to Parent Folder](README.md) | [← Back to Docs](README.md)
```

### Anchor Link Requirements
- Use lowercase with hyphens for anchor names
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Ensure anchor names match section headers exactly

[🔝](#table-of-contents)

---

## Markdown Best Practices

### Header Hierarchy
```markdown
# Main Document Title (H1 - once per document)
## Major Section (H2 - TOC entries)
### Subsection (H3 - sub-topics)
#### Detail Level (H4 - specific details)
```

### Code Blocks
```markdown
```python
# Code examples with language specification
def example_function():
    return "Hello, World!"
``` 
```

### Lists and Structure
```markdown
### Bulleted Lists
- First item
- Second item
  - Sub-item
  - Another sub-item

### Numbered Lists
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

### Emphasis and Formatting
```markdown
**Bold text** for important terms
*Italic text* for emphasis
`Code snippets` for inline code
> Blockquotes for important notes
```
